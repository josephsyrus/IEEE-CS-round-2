**Task 1:**  
Heart disease detection (Must): The Heart Disease Prediction problem aims to develop a model that can accurately predict the likelihood of an individual having heart disease based on various medical and lifestyle factors. Given a dataset containing information such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and other relevant clinical indicators, the goal is to build a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention for heart disease.

Implementation:  
Framework used: SciKit Learn, Python  
Split the dataset into two, one being test data and the other being training data.
Using a Logistic Regression model, we derive relations between the features and the target and rank it based on the accuracy score.
Logistic Regression gives an output of either 0 (false) or 1 (true).

**Task 2:**  
FIFA World Cup 2026 Win Probability Predictor Project (Try): The FIFA Win Predictor aims to develop a model that accurately predicts the outcomes of football matches. Given historical data such as team performance, player statistics, match location and other relevant factors, the goal is to create a predictive model that forecasts the probability of a team winning, losing, or drawing a match. 

Implementation:  
Framework used: SciKit Learn, Python  
Split the dataset into training and testing data.
Assign numeric values for each team, venues, etc.
Using Random Forest algorithm, we can predict whether the match will be a Win, Loss or Draw
